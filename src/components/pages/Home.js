        Hello! I'm an amatuer web developer interested in the tech industry and gaming.

      <h2>How I got started</h2>
      <p>I began this journey by signing up for a full-time 90 day bootcamp course provided
        by the Univercity of Central Florida. I had NO prior knowledge of coding, and only
        had a surface/hobbyist level of knowledge of computers. The bootcamp started simple
        in the first month with html and CSS, and light javascript. I felt confident that
        first month; but was immediately humbled going into the second month with the
        introduction of more advanced JavaScript, databases with DBeaver, and node. The third
        month felt like the longest month, </p>
